You are now an incumbent of the tech industry. Your performance and skillset can be highly influenced.
It is never too late to find a mentor who will influence you positively, stir your curiosity and give you
tools to grow.</p>
<p>Far too many people have gone through what you are going through and know how to navigate through it.
Having a mentor will make you feel fulfilled and extremely successful.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Success Rates of Entreprenuership Mentorship</strong></p>
<p>Case in point is mentorship through entreprenuership. According to a Tech Crunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/22/mentors-are-the-secret-weapons-of-successful-startups/">article</a> released in 2015, 33 percent of founders who are mentored by successful entrepreneurs went on to become top performers.
Entreprenuers of top tech companies like Facebook and Dropbox were all mentored by veterans of successful startups.
While these success stories of mentorship happened farther along in their careers, one day they were in the exact same position you were.
It was the influence of their peers [as well as their wit and drive] that got them to where they are now.
The Software Engineering profession is a service-based industry filled with extremely intelligent folks, some of whom are typing away at the desk next to you.
Say hi, get to know them, and ask them for tips. Growing your knowledge will make you an incredibly valuable asset.</p>
<h2>Finding a Mentor</h2><p>If you do find someone a table over who you feel would be a great fit for mentoring, then great! For some, the search is not all that easy and requires expanding their boundaries outside the office.
You can find mentors at Meetups and Events, in different divisions of your company, or someone in a different geographic region.
There are no boundaries!</p>
<h2>Maintaining a Mentor-Mentee Relationship</h2><pre><code>&quot;Stop the &#39;will you be my mentor?&#39; emails and start being present to embrace the learning opportunities all around you.&quot;
- Shark Tank&#39;s Robert Herjavec
</code></pre><p>The great Robert Herjavec speaks much truth. Getting rid of the formalities and simply being present when you are interacting with your mentor(s) is an incredible start.</p>
<p>However, merely being present is not enough to properly nagivate and make the best out of a mentor-mentee relationship.
In fact, this relationship is tricky for most to properly maintain and grow for most.</p>
<p>A healthy mentor-mentee is one that entails the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recurring Meetings</strong> - The more you progress in your skill, the further your mentor can guide you. Regular contact is also good to keep you aligned with your goals.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Mentorship</strong> - Having a mentor with sufficient knowledge to share with you</li>
<li><strong>Concise Yet Efficient</strong> - Mentors are typically extremely busy -- mentees do not sought full solutions, but rather tips and pointers that direct them to the right path.</li>
<li><strong>Traction in Utilization</strong> - Mentees who utilize these tips and communicate the results give mentors transparecy of their influence, making them proud and eager to share more.</li>
</ul>
<p>May your quest to find a mentor be fruitful. In fact, this toolkit came about as a result of intermittently serving as a knowledge-base for people still on the search.</p></div><div class="footer-container"><div class="footer"><div>Copyright @ 2016</div><div>The Early Career Toolkit is protected by the MIT license.</div><div>All Rights Reserved</div></div></div></div></body></html>
