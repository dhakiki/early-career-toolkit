Focus on a Software Stack
---

While considering your general career path (moving onto management or managing stacks) is good too, your focus this year should be on finding the stack that brings out the awesome in you.

Chances are you'll have a stack picked out for you when you start (it's either embedded in the role or you're working for a multi-stack company and you'll be allocated by availability).
And that's ok -- this early on, it's hard to know what stack will have you dreaming about it in your sleep (well, that will happen regardless).

Say, at some point in your first year, you come to the realization you're not super stoked about the stack you're working in. Now what?
Go to meetups and surround yourself with other people building in the same stack. Use your free time to explore and start building out a side project in a stack that pulls your interest.
Bring the project in and show your office. Continuously voice your interest and desire to change stacks.
The idea here is that, in doing so, you are showing your colleagues you are capable which will, in turn, eventually lead to your transition.

    Please Note: Because of the generally high learning curve when working on a new stack,
    level out your skills in your assigned stack first before taking on this extra workload.
    Otherwise, you'll burn out. And we wouldn't want that now would we?

Now that you're set on your stack, let's focus next on making you extremely [productive](customize_your_environment), shall we?
