<p>Congratulations! You landed your first software engineering job (or will soon be on your way to).
That's an incredible accomplishment! The diligence and effort required to land a job as an engineer are immense.
Pat yourself on the back! The year ahead will be one of immense growth and self-learning.</p>

<p>This repo serves to aide you in having a successful first year on the job.
Having access to this knowledge will give you a helpful boost and will help you lean in and become the best engineer you can be.
Many start their career (and often go through it) without gaining this information and there is a huge community of people around the
world who have acquired great tips they wish they had when they were starting out.</p>

<h2>
<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h2>

<p>Now, your first goal is to prove that you can deliver.
Building accountability and trust is incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, the problems you will be attempting to solve industry are far more complex and messy than the controlled environment of university or bootcamp.
This <a href="http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2015/06/01/the-role-of-a-senior-developer/">blog post</a> discusses the three main stages of growth as as a software developer: junior, intermediate, and senior.
Your goal in the first six months is to assume the role of the good junior developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good junior developer can be given a known task, and be expected to execute it quickly, and well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speed and quality is key here. Various tips throughout this toolkit will help speed accelerate execution.
Now some people can remain in this level for ten years. But not you! You're reading this toolkit!
If you follow these tips, by the end of year one you will assume the role of a good intermediate developer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good intermediate developer needs less supervision. They can be trusted to raise issues of code design, and play a valuable role in design discussions. They are also the “workhorses” of the dev team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are an important contributor to your team. You review PRs and give your peers valuable feedback.
You're following good coding practices and have mastered the art of incremental progress (topics covered in the toolkit).
You'll start getting into the habit of being able to plan and thinking about the overall picture instead of just cranking out a feature.</p>

<h2>
<a id="execution" class="anchor" href="#execution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Execution</h2>

<p>You'll be there in no time ^ time flies. But, lets jump back to the present and talk specifics, shall we?</p>

<p>This toolkit will cover the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="content/stack_focus.md">Focus on a Software Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="content/customize_your_environment.md">Customize a Productive Coding Environment</a></li>
<li><a href="content/best_coding_practices.md">Best Coding Practices</a></li>
<li><a href="content/mentorship_guide.md">Mentorship Guide</a></li>
</ul>
